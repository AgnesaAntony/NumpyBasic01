# NumPy Basics â€“ Learning by Practice

This notebook contains my hands-on practice with NumPy, the powerful numerical computing library in Python. The concepts covered here were learned through W3Schools' NumPy tutorial, which provided a clear and beginner-friendly introduction.
# âœ… Topics Covered

    1.Array Creation & Basic Operations
      Understanding how to create arrays and perform element-wise operations like addition.

    2.Random Number Generation
      Using numpy.random to generate random integers and floating-point numbers for simulations and data testing.

    3.Universal Functions (Ufuncs)
      Applying NumPyâ€™s built-in mathematical functions such as np.sqrt(), np.exp(), and np.sin() to perform fast, vectorized operations on arrays.
